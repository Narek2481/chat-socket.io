# Project Name
Chat for react.js  node.js  socket.io 

This project consists of a server and a client.

## Server

### Installation

1. Navigate to the server directory: `cd server/`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Starting the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev

The server will start in development mode using nodemon, which enables automatic restarts when changes are made to the code. Alternatively, you can use npm start to start the server without automatic restarts.

The server will start on port 5000 by default. If port 5000 is already in use, the server will automatically attempt to use the next available port.

## Client
Installation
Navigate to the client directory: cd client/
Install dependencies: npm install
Starting the Client
To start the client-side application, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The client will start on port 3001 by default. Make sure port 3000 is available and not occupied by other applications on your system. If port 3000 is already in use, you can change the port configuration in the client code.

Notes
Ensure that both the server and client are running simultaneously for the full functionality of the application.
You may need to update the server or client configuration files based on your specific requirements.
